# Lara De Cillis - Full Stack Developer

Currently, I am training as a Full Stack developer at Henry, but my primary interest is in Frontend development. My journey in programming began in mid-2022, and since then, I haven't stopped. 


## About Me

I consider myself a very creative person. A significant part of that I owe to my photography studies, where I explored visual storytelling, color theory, composition, and, consequently, my creativity. This education gave me a unique perspective, allowing me to combine my recent technical skills with artistic sensibility to design websites that not only function well but are also visually pleasing.

I firmly believe in the importance of aesthetics and its application in web development, and I strive to balance harmony in design with functionality.


## Tools I Use

- Frontend Â» React, Redux, Styled-Component, CSS Modules.
- Backend Â» NodeJS, ExpressJS, Sequelize
- Database Â» MySQL/Workbench, PostgreSQL.
- Version control Â» Git, GitHub.
- Design Â» Material UI, UI/UX Developer, Figma.
